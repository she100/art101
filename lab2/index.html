			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>My partner is named Riley! She has great taste in fashion!</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, create a basic HTML file and a CSS file, edit it, view it in your browser, and inspect it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I could not figure out why my partner description was within the challenge box. My partner helped me solve this problem!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment felt like a good exercise starter. I tried several different CSS functions and invested a lot of time into understanding this assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My efforts were successful! I ended up having a complete Lab 2 webpage and also got to add a link to my Lab 2 on my homepage.</p>
