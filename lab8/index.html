			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had issues with my console showing my array with the different results and true/false results. I didn't have enough time to fix this problem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was interesting, and I liked that I could see the results in the JavaScript console window. I'm going to return to this assignment to sort the issues out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p2>Here is the output! Look at the JavaScript Console for this one =].</p2>
