			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
					<p>I decided to fix my Lab 3 for this challenge.</p>
			</div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem in Lab 3 was that the image that I attached to the results section did not show up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It took a little bit of time to review this old lab and get myself familiar with it again. 
						But once I found the problem, fixing it was easy due to the debugging techniques 
						that I learned in class.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This lab was successful. Go to "Debugging" to see the changes I made for Lab 3!</p>

				<h3>Debugging</h3>
				<p>The issue with Lab 3 was that the screenshot included didn't show up. It looked like a little pixelated square which meant 
					either something was wrong with the file or code. I first looked at my HTML code for any formatting issues. Nothing was wrong with it, 
					so then I checked to see the uploaded image. I didn't see it in my images folder on VS Code nor did I find it at all when I pressed the 
					"Follow link" popup after hovering on the link. The image wasn't uploaded at all. So then this was an easy fix, I just needed to reupload the screenshot.
				</p>
				<p>Here are screenshots of my debugged code and working output.</p>
