			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with changing the size of my portrait. I edited the CSS page however it remained unchange. It wasn't until I realized that I was supposed to edit the image's size in the homepage CSS page after accidentally clicking on it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I liked this assignment! I have a better understanding of CSS style pages now.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I added another header, more lines of text, and bulleted list of my art-related interests, and a picture of myself.</p>
