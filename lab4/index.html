			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into sizing problems with the text in which they were way too big and spread out. I unfortunately could not figure out how to solve this problem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a bit tricky and confusing. Making the pseudocode with my partner was fun and I realized that a lot of details goes into the pool game!</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

				<pre><code>
					<h3>Task 1: making a collage</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Find paper supplies to use for collage; ie: Magazines, Newspapers, Artbooks, Packaging, Trash, Photos, etc.</li>
							<li>Search through to see what shapes, images, or colors attract your eye.</li>
							<li>Cut out what you want to incorporate with an x-acto knife</li>
							<li>Place and rearrange cut-out material onto different mediums of paper to see if you’re ready to glue them down</li>
							<li>If needed draw own art to add to the collage</li>
							<li>Glue down the collage materials according to layering established in previous step</li>
							<li>If needed add additional materials to desired taste: ie; Pom pons, glitter, paint, additional paper materials, drawings, gems, etc.</li>
							<li>If needed cover collage with mod podge or other adhesive to retain collage shape</li>
							<li>Allow it to dry</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Task 2: Pool</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Load graphics:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>load a pool table graphic. </li>
									<li>load pool ball graphics, 15 labeled 1-15, colored according to standardized pool tables and an additional white pool ball graphic for white ball.</li>
									<li>load pool cue graphic</li>
									<li>define pool table boundaries in which balls stay inside</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Define user action conditions</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Putting white ball into a pocket skips a user’s turn, allowing the opponent to place it anywhere during their turn</li>
									<li>Putting the correctly assigned ball into a pocket permits another turn</li>
									<li>Putting the opponent’s ball into a pocket gives them a point and counts as a turn</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Win condition</li>
								<ul>
									<li>After a user’s assigned balls are in pockets, the black 8-ball must be hit into a pocket for a win</li>
									<li>Putting black 8-ball into a pocket makes opponent win</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Apply physics simulations to each manipulatable object on the pool table.</li>
							<li>Apply collision simulations for interactions between manipulatable parts of the pool table</li>
							<li>Set pool cue as free ranging object that can be pulled back and forth along the y-axis and x-axis and rotated 360 degrees around a point on the pool cue to</li>
							<li>interact with balls on the table.</li>
							<li>Set the defult break position</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Place white ball along the center</li>
									<li>Place racked colored balls opposite the white</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Assign one user to break the triangle, allow user input</li>
							<li>Use user input to determine next action. The user gets assigned either a solid or striped ball depending on the type of ball they put in.</li>
							<li>Allow second user input</li>
							<li>Loop user input turns and action conditions until the win condition happens</li>
